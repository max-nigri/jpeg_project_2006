in this project students build a jpeg encoder in hardware, using chip design techniques
by the end of this project, one will be able to provide a bmp image file, the testbench will read this file encode it, and output a jpeg file
the output jpeg file should be valid for viewing with a browser or any image viewer
in the future, one can go further and map this design to an FPGA board
